# README

My wife and I recently moved to Orlando. We wanted to "100%" all of the parks here. Meaning we want to complete 
all of the rides, shows, and restaurants at all of the parks. This app was created to help us keep track of 
our progress. It is also a showcase of my web development skillset. This is a mobile first app and does not have desktop styling 
as we will be accessing this app almost exclusively from our phones while in the parks. It's intended to fit the iPhone 15 Pro screen size but should 
work on most modern phones.
