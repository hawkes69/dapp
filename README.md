# README

This is a working directory that contains a simple app to track the completion percentage of various amusement parks in Orlando. My wife and I would like to "100%" (complete every attraction, watch every show, and eat at every restaurant) each of the parks and want a simple web app to keep track of our progress. This will be a mobile-first app and I don't plan to have a working desktop implementation as we will almost exclusively access this from our phones while in the parks.

## Tech Stack
