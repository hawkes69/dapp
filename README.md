# README

This is a working directory that contains a simple app to track completion percentage of various amusement parks in Orlando. My wife and I would like to 100% each of the parks and want a simple web app to keep track of our progress.

## Things that need to be implemented. 

* Ruby Backend
* User Authentication
* React front end
* Rails api

## Feature wishlist

* Progress bar
* Date night generator (uncompleted ride, restaurant, and show)
* Fog of war map to demonstrate progression
