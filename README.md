# README

This is a working directory that contains a simple app to track the completion percentage of various amusement parks in Orlando. My wife and I would like to "100%" (complete every ride, watch every show, and eat at every restaurant) each of the parks and want a simple web app to keep track of our progress. This will be a mobile-first app and I don't plan to have a working desktop implementation as we will almost exclusively access this from our phones while in the parks.

## Tech Stack

- Vite React frontend
- Ruby on Rails Backend

## Demo Site

I have not yet hosted a demo site. I will update this section when I have a demo site available.

## TODO

- I am aware of an edge case where the animations for area completion and experience completion can play at the same time. It is rare enough that I am not going to bother to fix it. It is a known issue and I am okay with it. For the purposes of this app it's all right. I may come back to it in the future but I'd rather get this up and hosted than spend more time monkeying around with it. 

- HOST!!!!
