# README

This is a working directory that contains a simple app to track the completion percentage of various amusement parks in Orlando. My wife and I would like to "100%" (complete every attraction and eat at every restaurant) each of the parks and want a simple web app to keep track of our progress. This will be a mobile-first app and I don't plan to have a working desktop implementation as we will almost exclusively access this from our phones while in the parks. 

## Things that need to be implemented. 

* Ruby Backend
* User Authentication
* React front end
* Rails api
* Host app

## Feature wishlist

* Progress bar
* Date night generator (uncompleted ride, restaurant, and show)
* Fog of war map to demonstrate progression

## TODO
-[] Shows Table and data
-[] Restaurants Table and data
-[] users table
-[] user authentication
-[] user login
-[] move completion tracking to user table
